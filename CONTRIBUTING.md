All users are invited and encouraged to make their own branches to the repository and to submit pull requests to bring their changes into the main branch. Please do submit Issues on GitHub for any bugs or inconveniences, no matter how big or small. 

A recommended workflow is the following.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Make your own branch (or multiple branches). If you prefer to fork the repository, please do.
3. Push your commits to GitHub often (or whenever it is convenient).
4. Development of new code will hopefully be compatible with the larger package ECCOtour.jl. 
5. Happy hacking! We look forward to collaborating with you.
